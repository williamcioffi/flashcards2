- expects a key file csv named `imagekey.csv`
- expects a directory called `www/images/` with image files
- the images are rendered wtih <img> so anything that works in your browser will work (e.g., png, jpg, but not usually tiff).

`imagekey.csv` should have minimum two columns (others are ignored):

- `filename` (just name not path)
- `label`
